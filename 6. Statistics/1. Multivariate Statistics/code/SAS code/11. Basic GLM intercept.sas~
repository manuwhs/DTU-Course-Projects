/* This example:
	- We use a simple model with and without intercept.
	- When we have intercept:
	    - If no Factors, then the intercept is just the the mean of the Y that is substracted to the estimation.
	    - If there are Factors: Then the intercept is the same but for a given combiantion of factors
	      and then the rest are adapted to that.
	      We have one more parameter though ! And we lose one of the interactions which will become the intercept.
