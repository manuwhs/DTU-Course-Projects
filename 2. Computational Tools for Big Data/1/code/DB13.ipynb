We get and count the unique words in the document with the _unique_ command, having previously sorted the words so that it requieres less computational cost to get the unique words. Finally we sort the unique counted words in decreasing order and obtain the last top words. We achieved this by running following shell command :\n",

    "__Assignment__: Last week you read in a dataset for this Kaggle competition and created a bag-of-words representation on the review strings. Train a logistic regression classifier for the competition using your bag-of-words features (and possibly some of the others) to predict the variable “requester_received_pizza”. For this exercise, you might want to work a little bit more on your code from last week. Use 90% of the data as training data and 10% as test data.\n",

    "__Solution:__  \n",
    "We trained classifier using bag of words and then also using other features from dataset. Accuracy of classifier trained with bag of words (using relative frequencies) is around 75%, which is the same performance as guessing the most frequent output class. When we trained classifier also with other features we got accuracy 76 %, which is also similar. The dimensionaly of the input is around 8000, which is too high to allow a good prediction using a logistic regressor. Using TF-IDF features and a Naive Bayes classifies probably would lead to much better results."
